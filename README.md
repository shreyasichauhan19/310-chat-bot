# COSC 310 - Individual Project Repository. Customer Service Chatbot.

## API Implemented 

1. Wikipedia API
Uses keywords from the conversation to return all the related Wikipedia articles. The function wikipedia(string) recieves input from the user and uses that to create a URL. That URL is displayed on the console with the title of the article.

2. Google Translate
Similar to the Wikipedia API the translater(string) function takes the user input and translates that into english. That makes the bot more efficient as it can easily translate words and sentences to a language the bot understands.
